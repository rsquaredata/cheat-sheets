# 🎬 Scene 1 — Relationship Building

**Rina (voice-over)**  
“It is 7 PM on the Lyon 2 Bron campus. The trio must negotiate a project for a company competition.  
Four variables: **time**, **complexity**, **technology**, **prize**.  
They begin with <span style='color:red'>relationship-building techniques</span>.”

**Axel**  
“So LP, how was your week? Still working on that compiler?”  
→ <span style='color:red'>Showing interest</span>

**Léo-Paul**  
“Yeah… still obsessed.”

**Axel**  
“Your skills are insane. I admire that.”  
→ <span style='color:red'>Flattery</span>

**Olivier (arriving with coffees)**  
“Sorry I’m late — work was hell. Coffee for everyone!”  
→ <span style='color:red'>Generosity</span>

**Axel**  
“Thanks, really needed it.”  
→ <span style='color:red'>Gratitude</span>

“My cat shredded all my notes this morning, but hey… he’s cute.”

# 🎬 Scene 2 — Establishing Procedure & Opening Points

**Rina (voice-over)**  
“They enter Phase 2: <span style='color:red'>establishing procedure</span> and giving opening points.”

**Axel**  
“Just thinking aloud… I can invest **35% time**, want **standard-plus complexity**, and for prize, effort matters.  
If I give 35%, I want **40%**.”  
→ <span style='color:red'>Hedging</span>  
→ <span style='color:red'>Opening point</span>

**Olivier**  
“I work 25h/week. Max I can give is **20%**.  
But I refuse to earn less than the others.  
<span style='color:green'>From my perspective...</span> equal partners deserve equal shares.”  
→ <span style='color:red'>Reservation point</span>

**Léo-Paul**  
“So equal pay for fewer hours?  
<span style='color:green'>Do you mean</span> that?”  
→ <span style='color:red'>Checking question</span>

**Axel**  
“Can you expand on that?  
<span style='color:green'>What exactly do you mean by</span> ‘quality contribution’?”  
→ <span style='color:red'>Probing question</span>

**Léo-Paul**  
“My opening: **expert-level complexity**, **React**, **40% time**.  
Prize is flexible.”  
→ <span style='color:red'>Opening point</span>

---

# 🎬 Scene 3 — Clarifying

**Axel**  
“Expert-level?  
Expert-level?”  
→ <span style='color:red'>Echo question</span>

**Olivier**  
<span style='color:green'>I'm afraid that doesn't work for me.</span>  
“That sounds like more than 20% work…”

---

# 🎬 Scene 4 — Early Bargaining

**Rina (voice-over)**  
“Now bargaining begins.”

**Léo-Paul**  
“I can lower to standard-plus **if** we use web technologies.”  
→ <span style='color:red'>Conditional concession</span>

**Axel**  
“That’s tough for me…”

**Léo-Paul**  
“I’ll take full frontend. You do backend only.”  
→ <span style='color:red'>Trade concession</span>

**Olivier**  
“I still want equal prize.  
<span style='color:green'>I'm afraid I had something different in mind.</span>”  
→ <span style='color:red'>Reservation point</span>

---

# 🎬 Scene 5 — Deadlock & Drama

**Rina (voice-over)**  
“They hit a <span style='color:red'>sticking point</span>: the prize.”

**Axel**  
“If LP does 40%, I do 35%, you do 20%, equal prize is unfair.”

**Olivier**  
“So my work is worth less because I have a job?”

**Axel**  
“No — but time matters.”

**Olivier (angry)**  
“You’re <span style='color:red'>backing me into a corner</span>!”

**Olivier**  
“That’s it — I need a break.  
If this continues, I might walk away.”  
→ <span style='color:red'>Time-out</span>  
→ <span style='color:red'>BATNA threat</span>

*He leaves.*

# 🎬 Scene 6 — BATNA Revelation

**Rina (voice-over)**  
“They now consider their <span style='color:red'>BATNA</span>.”

**Axel**  
“Our BATNA: minimal Python app, equal prize, zero chance of winning.”

**Léo-Paul**  
“That would be awful.  
<span style='color:green'>It is crucial that</span> we keep ambition.”  
→ <span style='color:red'>Giving a hint</span>

**Olivier (returning)**  
“…Okay. What’s the BATNA?”

**Axel**  
“Equal share… of a losing project.”

**Olivier**  
“Oh.”

---

# 🎬 Scene 7 — Strategic Logrolling

**Rina (voice-over)**  
“Now they enter real logrolling.”

**Léo-Paul**  
“Hypothetically…  
<span style='color:green'>What if</span> I accept **32%** prize in exchange for React?”  
→ <span style='color:red'>Hypothetical question</span>  
→ <span style='color:red'>Trade concession</span>

**Axel**  
“You’d give some ground on prize to keep React?”  
→ <span style='color:red'>Giving some ground</span>

**Olivier**  
“Do I get 33%?  
→ <span style='color:red'>Checking question</span>

**Axel**  
“Yes — **if** you take testing, doc, QA.”  
→ <span style='color:red'>If-sentence</span>

**Olivier**  
“I accept…  
<span style='color:green'>I am willing to accept ... if ...</span> my 20% limit is protected.”  
→ <span style='color:red'>Conditional concession</span>

**Axel**  
“If LP invests 40%, I’ll invest 40% too — **if** I get 35%.”  
→ <span style='color:red'>If-sentence</span>

**Léo-Paul**  
“I can live with that.”  
→ <span style='color:red'>Giving some ground</span>

# 🎬 Scene 8 — Clinching the Deal

**Rina (voice-over)**  
“They now <span style='color:red'>clinch the deal</span>.”

**Axel (summary)**  
“Summary:

- Time: LP 40%, Axel 40%, Olivier 20%  
- Prize: Olivier 33%, Axel 35%, LP 32%  
- Complexity: standard-plus  
- Tech: React stack  
- Roles:  
  - LP → frontend  
  - Axel → backend  
  - Olivier → testing/doc/QA  

<span style='color:green'>Is it alright with you?</span>  
→ <span style='color:red'>Checking understanding</span>”

**All**  
“Deal.”

# 🎬 Scene 9 — Tying Up Loose Ends

**Rina (voice-over)**  
“And they <span style='color:red'>tie up loose ends</span>.”

**LP**  
“So relieved it's not basic Python.”

**Olivier**  
“And I get my share without burnout.”

**Axel**  
“And fairness is respected.”

---

# 🎬 Epilogue

**Rina**  
And with that, the three students successfully negotiated a mutually-acceptable decision. After reaching a deadlock, they discussed their BATNA and each strategically traded variables. Léo traded prize money for his preferred technology and invested more time because he was passionate about web development. Oliver maintained his prize share by taking on all testing and documentation tasks. Axel invested more time than planned to help Léo, and took a portion of Léo's prize share in return. Their negotiation was complete.

“This negotiation used:  
<span style='color:red'>relationship-building</span>,  
<span style='color:red'>positions</span>,  
<span style='color:red'>probing</span>,  
<span style='color:red'>echo questions</span>,  
<span style='color:red'>sticking points</span>,  
<span style='color:red'>BATNA</span>,  
<span style='color:red'>conditional concessions</span>,  
<span style='color:red'>logrolling</span>,  
and <span style='color:red'>clinching the deal</span>.”
